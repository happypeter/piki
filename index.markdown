<h2 style="text-align:center">piki</h2>
<br />

I start [piki](/piki/pages/piki_name.html), becasue I love <www.linfo.org> too much, so that I really want
one for my own. 

piki is Peter's personal knowledge base. It will follow linfo style, but I
only copy things I am interested in. 

Piki will foucs on concepts, it is not the place you can learn skills(vim,
git, bash  scripting...) it's just knowledge.
