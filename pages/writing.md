>The results left psychologists with something of a mystery. Why would talking
about a traumatic experience have almost no effect but writing about it yield
such significant benefits? From a psychological perspective, talking and
writing are very different. Talking can often be somewhat unstructured,
disorganized, even chaotic. In contrast, writing encourages the creation of a
story line and structure that help people make sense of what has happened and
work towards a solution. In short, talking can add to a sense of confusion,
but writing provides a more systematic, solution-based approach.
