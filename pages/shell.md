A shell is a program that provides the traditional, text-only user
interface for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. Its primary
function is to read commands that are typed into a console (i.e., an
all-text display mode) or terminal window (an all-text window) in a GUI
(graphical user interface) and then execute (i.e., run) them.
