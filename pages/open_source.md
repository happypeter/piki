title: Open Source Definition

OpenSource literaily means the source code of the software is open to everyone. 

But if you are a Linux man, maybe you want to consider it something more. 
Firstly, it is "the only right way to do software", as Linus Torwalds put it.
Secondly, it is a philosophy, which changed and still is changing my life. 

See [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) for more.
