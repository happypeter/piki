title: What is PIKI?
---
Piki is Peter's [wiki](wiki.html)

Piki is Peter's personal knowledge base. It will follow linfo style, but I
only copy things I am interested in. 

Piki will foucs on concepts, it is not the place you can learn skills( on how
to use vim, git, bash scripting...) it's just knowledge. It is just the way
wiki works, it is not like tutorial or screencasts.
