“Intelligence is the ability to avoid doing work, yet getting the work done”


### Kernel summit 2008:

"Real quality to me has always been making sure people are proud of the code
they write, and not so much in any particular thing you can do, it's more
about making people are involoved and take it personally, quality comes
from that in the end."
