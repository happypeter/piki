title: Operating System Definition
---

There is a nice [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) for this, with a nice graph there.

For me the most important part is:

    Which features are considered part of the operating system is defined
    differently in various operating systems. For example, Microsoft Windows
    considers its user interface to be part of the operating system, while many
    versions of Linux do not.

So do not try to be very clear on the definition of os.
